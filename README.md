# Crystal Combinatorial Optimization Program (CCOP)

This software package implements the Crystal Combinatorial Optimization Program (CCOP) that predicts the lowest atomic arrangement of fixed lattice. 

CCOP combines graph neural network and reinforcement learning to accelerate the search of crystal structure.
